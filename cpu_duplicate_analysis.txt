=== ANALYSIS: Why CPU Computes Shape Tensors Twice ===

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:

The CPU processes shape tensors twice because there are TWO separate functions that both call computeShapeTensors():

### 1. FIRST CALL: computeForceDensityStates() function (line 324)
- **Purpose**: Compute force density states for velocity calculation
- **Called from**: computeVelocity() function 
- **Location**: Inside the main velocity computation loop
- **Debug output**: "CPU PAIR PROCESSING" messages

### 2. SECOND CALL: computeDamageStatus() function (line 494)  
- **Purpose**: Compute damage status based on strain analysis
- **Called from**: main() function, BEFORE computeVelocity()
- **Location**: In the time step loop, executed before velocity computation
- **Usage**: For material damage assessment

## EXECUTION FLOW:
```
main() 
├── computeDamageStatus()           ← FIRST: calls computeShapeTensors (100 times)
│   └── computeShapeTensors()       ← for damage analysis
└── computeVelocity()               ← SECOND: calls computeShapeTensors (100 times)  
    └── computeForceDensityStates() ← for force computation
        └── computeShapeTensors()   ← same computation repeated!
```

## GPU vs CPU COMPARISON:

### GPU Behavior:
- GPU ONLY runs computeVelocity() equivalent (compute_velocity_kernel_GPU)
- GPU does NOT run damage computation in this test case
- GPU processes shape tensors ONCE (100 pairs total)

### CPU Behavior:  
- CPU runs BOTH computeDamageStatus() AND computeVelocity()
- CPU processes shape tensors TWICE (200 pairs total = 100 + 100)
- Same computeShapeTensors() function called twice with identical parameters

## IMPACT ON RESULTS:

The duplicate computation does NOT affect final results because:
1. ✅ Both calls use identical input parameters (same pi, pj, neighbors)
2. ✅ computeShapeTensors() is a pure function (no side effects)  
3. ✅ Each function uses its own local copy of the computed shape tensors
4. ✅ The velocity computation only uses its own computed shape tensors
5. ✅ The damage computation only uses its own computed shape tensors

## VERIFICATION NEEDED:
We should verify that final velocity results are identical between CPU and GPU
despite this computational inefficiency in the CPU version.
